# Overview

This repository contains the R code used for the master’s thesis introducing the random ilr data augmentation techniques. This project organizes R scripts, data sets, and outputs for a thesis project. Scripts in `R/` are typically numbered to indicate execution order (e.g., `R/00_data_prep` should be executed as first) or the the file that calls it. Data is expected under `data/` and the resulting files from the analysis are saved under `results/`.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preffered IDE.
3. Open the `.RProj` file.
4. Run `renv::restore()`. This will restore the environment needed to reproduce the analysis done locally in this project. 


### Running the Pipeline

The below graph explains the workflow needed to recreate the results obtained in teh thesis with teh specification whether a given step was run locally in the environmant specified by the `renv.loc` or on the computational server in the custom 

```r
source("R/00_data_prep")   # or source("R/00_data_prep.R") if you add the extension
```

Add additional numbered scripts (e.g., `R/01_analysis.R`, `R/02_models.R`) and run sequentially.

## Data

- Place original datasets in `data/raw/`.
- Write intermediate, cleaned data to `data/interim/` from preprocessing scripts.

## Reproducibility
